# Introduction

Our final product is a web application that aims to analyze and provide insights on essays or text data provided by users. 
The application will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract features, 
perform analysis, and generate predictions. This report provides an overview of how the final product will look like and the technologies
we are using.

# Web Application:

Our application accessible through a web browser, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with. 
The web application consist of different pages/screens to facilitate seamless user experience and efficient data processing.

# User Interface:

The user interface (UI) of our web application will comprise of intuitive input fields and forms for users to submit their essays or 
text data. Users have the option to select specific features or perform actions such as feature engineering. The UI will be designed to 
ensure ease of use and clarity of instructions.

# Backend:

The backend of our applicatio handle the processing and analysis of the text data. It responsible for receiving user input, 
performing feature extraction, applying feature engineering techniques, and generating predictions based on machine learning models. 
We are utilizing Flask, a Python web framework, to develop the backend of our application.

# Flask:

Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework in Python. It will serve as the foundation for our backend development. Flask allows
us to handle HTTP requests, define routes, manage application logic, and communicate with other components of our application.
It provides a flexible and scalable architecture for building web applications.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:

To process and analyze text data, we are utilizing popular NLP libraries in Python, such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn. 
These libraries offer a wide range of functions and algorithms for tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and feature 
extraction. Leveraging these libraries enable us to efficiently preprocess and analyze the text data provided by users.

# Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering techniques such as TF-IDF and word embedding are employed to enhance the predictive power of our machine learning models. We will leverage 
scikit-learn's preprocessing and feature selection modules to engineer and select relevant features from the text data.
Feature engineering help us extract meaningful insights and improve the accuracy of our predictions.

# Machine Learning Model:

Our final product incorporate the k nearest neighbor machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset. The model will be designed to make predictions
based on the extracted and engineered features.
